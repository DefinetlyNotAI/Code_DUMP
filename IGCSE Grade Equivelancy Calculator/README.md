### IG Mu3adala Calculator

A static web app that helps students estimate their IG O Level and A Level or AS Level equivalency (Mu3adala) using commonly used grade-to-percentage mappings in many Arab countries.

**Features**

- Add any number of O Levels, A Levels, and AS Levels
- Mark grades as confirmed or unconfirmed
- Automatic handling of AS pairs (2 AS = 1 A Level)
- Default 50% O Level / 50% A Level weighting
- Calculate current Mu3adala
- Predict minimum grades needed in unconfirmed A or AS subjects to break even at a target percentage

**Notes**

- Grade mapping is an approximation and may vary by country or year
- O Level grades below D are invalid
- A Level E is allowed
- Always double-check official equivalency rules for subject counts and weightings
