# Random Stupid ASM Attempt â€” Hack Club Arcade (aka RSASMA)

Welcome to a graveyard of half-baked ideas, cursed experiments, and a desperate attempt to understand Assembly, DLLs, and how computers... computer.

None of this is finished. None of this is tested. And all of this is, in some way, very stupid.
 But it's mine. And maybe one day, it'll mean something more than hours of fruitless debugging and emotional damage.

## ðŸ§® ASM Calc Attempts

### `ASM Calc Attempt 1\cpu-calc-basic.asm`

Basic attempt at creating a CPU-based calculator using Assembly. It's just barely alive.

### `ASM Calc Attempt 2\`

Second attempt, with a few more pieces:

- `calc_2.asm`: newer version of the calc code.
- `calc_2.obj`: output object file, untested.
- `crtdll.dll`: I don't even know why this is here. Probably regret.

## ðŸ§¬ DLL Decompile Attempt

### `DLL Decompile Attempt\`

- `dll.py`: Python script to inspect/decompile a DLL. It's confused. Iâ€™m confused.
- `README.md`: Yes, even my mess has metadata.

## ðŸ§  Logicytics ASM Attempts

### `Logicytics ASM Attempt 1\`

- `call_dll_and_save_info.cpp`: Calls a DLL and does... something.
- `sys.cpp`, `sys.h`: System interaction files, maybe for WMI or DLL hijinks.
- `wmi_query.cpp`: WMI query experiments. Possibly haunted.

### `Logicytics ASM Attempt 2\`

- `commands.txt`: List of mysterious commands I was planning to test.
- `func.py`, `test.py`: Python-side logic glue. Definitely broken.
- `sys.def`: Something to do with exporting DLL functions, I think.
- `Logicytics Project.url`: A URL shortcut to a fantasy that has materialized but not like this.
- `TODO.txt`: Evidence of ambition and denial.
