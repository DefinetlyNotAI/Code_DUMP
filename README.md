> [!NOTE]
>
> ## Most code here consists of tiny projects I’ve worked on. Some are abandoned or no longer work, while others include more effort and are somewhat more complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't trust commit history time, as most these projects were done back in 2020 covid era, but were rather archived in a USB before I discovered GitHub and created this repo, so don't judge any of the code based on commit dates!!
