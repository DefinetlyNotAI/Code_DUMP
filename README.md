> [!NOTE]
> ## This is just a random messy and at all not a serious repo, all its worth is to dump old, unfinished code that I want to look back into or maybe continue working on

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't trust commit history time, as most these projects were done back in 2020 covid era, but were rather archived in a USB before I discovered GitHub and created this repo, so don't judge any of the code based on commit dates!!
