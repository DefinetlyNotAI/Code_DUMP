> [!NOTE]
>
> ### Most code here consists of tiny projects I’ve worked on. Some are abandoned or no longer work, while others include more effort and are somewhat more complete.

> [!CAUTION]
> Many projects here are "archived" aka unmaintained by me and are also most likely offline/un-deployed (except pure static sites, which are managed by github pages)
>
> The issue here is many working projects requirements become vulnerable or outdated which results in many dependabot security highlights, these are all ignored by me, but intentionally kept open so if this code is ever used, the developer should know to update the packages to more secure versions and NOT blindly copy paste irrelevent of what is being pasted
>
> Please remember to update your vulnerable packages!!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't trust commit history time, as most these projects were done back in 2020 covid era, but were rather archived in a USB before I discovered GitHub and created this repo, so don't judge any of the code based on commit dates!!
