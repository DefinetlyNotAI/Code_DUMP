### Highlights
- Each glitch is implemented as a function that returns two sub-functions: one for the glitch effect and one for the cure.
- A registry dictionary (`effects`) maps effect names to their respective functions.
- There's an optional main loop (commented out) to sequentially run and cure all glitches.

### Notes
- Some features require external dependencies like `pyautogui`, `pygetwindow`, and `winsound`.
- Unimplemented or partially implemented glitches include `task_switch_lock` and `volume_spike`.
- The script's purpose seems to be experimental or humorous and is not intended for practical use.
