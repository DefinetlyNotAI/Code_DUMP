Build
    RP w0 has a pwngotchi custom build that allows the wave-share v4 e-ink display to be used.
    RP 4B has kali linux OS with a custom start-up script,

RPw0 Plan
    The RPw0 will have a script that acts as a mod, if the pwn is in Manual mode
    it will send all its captured Wifi handshakes via ble to my RP4B

RP4B Plan
    My RP4B also has a custom script that ALWAYS runs, which saves any handshake packet file, and uses
    builtin scripts to crack the handshakes and get the password key, afterwords it sends it to me via a discord webhook
    to prevent spam, the webhook url is gotten from a pre-configured file (acts like a env variable)
    that is called discord.webhook, it simply just includes the webhook URL, that's it

You must include `config.json` in this directory

In the sd card of pwngotchi: /etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml
Edit it to allow usage of plugins, by adding or editing this line:
`main.custom_plugins = "/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/"`
Then put the rp0w.py script in /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/ in the SD card
