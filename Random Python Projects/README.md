I will not work on this, update this or do anything remote to fix or add features

These are just old python projects I made when I was 9-13 years old...

> Note that NIRT is the National Institute for Robotics and Technology, in Jordan, where I learnt robotics and the basics of Circuitry, Soldering, Drones, VEX, Lego Mindstorms, Arduino, and the following competitions; Ball Collector, Sumo Robot

Enjoy.
